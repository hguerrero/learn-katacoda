Quarkus is a full-stack, Kubernetes-native [Java framework](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-a-Java-framework) made for Java virtual machines (JVMs) and native compilation, optimizing Java specifically for containers and enabling it to become an effective platform for [serverless](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud-native-apps/what-is-serverless), [cloud](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/cloud), and [Kubernetes](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/containers/what-is-kubernetes) environments.

This scenario has shown you how to develop with Quarkus to connect to Apache Kafka using the [SmallRye Reactive Messaging](https://smallrye.io/smallrye-reactive-messaging) to build data streaming applications.
